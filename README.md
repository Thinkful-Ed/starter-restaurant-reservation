## Documentation of API
For the API, the user can create new reservations and tables. The data can be updated and reservations and tables can also be deleted. The tables data and reservations data for each day can also be retrieved from the database by date. The API also checks to see if the information that is entered is valid

## Summary
For the project, the user is able to create new reservations and tables as well as retrieve this information from the database. The application handles some errors and allows the user to be able to manage and see reservations at the restaurant in an efficient and error-resistant manner. This helps to ensure the organization of reservations and tables at a busy restaurant. The user is assumed to be restaurant staff who enter this information rather than customers themselves.
